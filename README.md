# ArchitecturalDiagrams-InMotion
This repo contains files generated by online architecture diagram builders, where the builder has an option to save to GitHub.

## Contents
There are no folders in this repo as there should not be enough objects in it to warrant folders.  If this changes then this approach will be re-accessed.

Each diagram needs two objects:
- The diagram itself
- An accompanying Markdown document about the diagram.  The contents for this aren't fixed, and can include:
- 1. The project, blog post or session the diagram is for (if applicable).
  2. Notes about what the end result of the image is supposted to be.
  3. TODO or FIX actions.
 
- The doc **must** share the name of the diagram, and **must** end with the diagram's current status.  EG:
-  1. diagram-staging
   2. diagram-holding
 
- There should be no Lake document, as nothing in a Lake status has been started.
- The status must change via git commit.
